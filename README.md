# Fun_with_Android
A few apps created in my undergrad android development course

There are four apk files which will run a few of the apps created for this course.  To run the apk files, you will need an Adnroid emulator of some sort.  If using Android Studio, you can simply open up the AVD manager.  When these were created, they worked well on a Pixel 3 API 29, Android 10.0 device.  Simply start the emulator, drag the apk file onto the screen, use your mouse to tap/drag up to find the specified apk app and click to run it.  Screenshots are included here with app descriptions.

*  ## Bears Beets Battlestar
      Just what you hoped it would be...a modified rocks, paper, scissors game with Dwight as your commentator. You want to run this one to really get the full experience.
